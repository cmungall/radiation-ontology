def: "The condition of being subjected to electromagnetic radiation, that is, energy emitted and absorbed by charged particles, which exhibits wave-like behavior as it travels and has both electric and magnetic field components, with wavelengths between 10 and 120 nm. Radiation (i.e. ultraviolet light) at this wavelength is considered  ionizing, that is, composed of photons that individually carry enough energy to liberate an electron from an atom or molecule without raising the bulk material to ionization temperature."
