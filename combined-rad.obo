In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

def: "The condition of being subjected to electromagnetic radiation, that is, energy emitted and absorbed by charged particles, which exhibits wave-like behavior as it travels and has both electric and magnetic field components, with wavelengths between 120 and 400 nm. Radiation (i.e. ultraviolet light) at this wavelength does not have sufficient energy to liberate electrons from atoms or molecules although it can induce photochemical reactions, or accelerate radical reactions."
